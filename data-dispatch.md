**Data Dispatch** is a channel for disseminating useful and interesting content about all things in the data landscape:
data engineering, data science, analytics engineering, data analytics, data visualisation, etc.

I won't necessarily be posting articles regularly; it really depends on how busy I am and how many articles of interest
I've managed to read. I'm also not interested in only posting _new_ articles. I often come across older articles that
pique my interest, and I'm assuming that others will benefit from these too.

The content is currently available on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/_data_dispatch_) and here. (I may expand to other
channels in the future.)

I keep an archive of Data Dispatch postings on this site, which you can find [here](/posts/). This is only periodically
updated, so check the X channel for more recent posts. (A bonus of this little initiative is that I'm basically
bookmarking the articles I found interesting, so this also serves as a sort of personal reading list.)
