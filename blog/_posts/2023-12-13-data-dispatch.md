**Data Dispatch** is a channel I've recently created (in September of this year) for disseminating useful and
interesting content about all things in the data landscape. I'm talking topics from data engineering, data science,
analytics engineering, data analytics, data visualisation, and so on. Maybe some software development and dev-ops too,
so long as it's data-adjacent.

The content is currently available via two channels, _viz._ X/Twitter and WhatsApp:

- [X channel](https://x.com/_data_dispatch_)
- [WhatsApp channel](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va8rOJ3FcowCLmenIc1t)

It started as a WhatsApp channel—shortly after Meta launched the channel feature globally—but I quickly added it to
X as well. I ultimately see it expanding to some other platforms though, for instance LinkedIn.

Content-wise, I started Data Dispatch as a sort of newsletter, in which I can share articles of interest that I’ve come
across (since I read a lot). It currently still follows that model. My ultimate goal, however, would be to also create
original content (some of it via this blog, but other content could live directly on the various channels).

I'm also not interested in only posting _new_ articles. I often come across older articles that pique my interest, and
I'm assuming that others will benefit from these too. This will also prevent trend-bias, like I've noticed in some
email newsletters I belong to: almost all recent content is AI- or LLM-based, because that's what's trendy now.

Go check it out, and let me know what you think! If you'd like to submit articles for consideration, then I'd be
interested in that too. You can reach me on X ([@\_data_dispatch\_](https://x.com/_data_dispatch_)).
