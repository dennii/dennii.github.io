## Work experience

### Industry experience

**Feb 2024–Present** Senior Developer, BSC Quant

BSC Quant is a quantitative finance startup that is developing an innovative and sophisticated data-driven algorithmic
trading platform.

I serve as the primary technical architect and developer of this platform, though my role spans software development,
data engineering, data science, DevOps and MLOps:

- Solution design and implementation of the trading algorithms and platform, the infrastructure it runs on, and the
  data architecture (data models and ETL pipelines).
- Management and maintenance of the above.
- Analytics and development of ML algorithms, and their integration into the platform.

**Oct 2023–Jan 2024** Technical Lead, Business Science Corporation

**Sep 2020–Oct 2023** Analytics Consultant, ---

**Oct 2018–Aug 2020** Analyst, ---

Selected projects:

- _Logistics_. Fuel consumption, asset utilisation, and labour utilisation diagnostics for a large logistics company, from the viewpoint of lean waste management principles. Starting as an intermediate analytics engineer on the fuel workstream, I became technical lead for the project.

  My roles (analytics engineering and team lead):

  - Development and maintenance of fuel consumption data model and pipelines. (This involved sophisticated transformations on billions of GPS positions.)
  - Solution migration to Databricks, including migrating data sources to the client's data warehouse and extensive QA of the latter. (I improved ETL pipeline robustness, decreased run time by over 80\%, and increased data quality.)
  - Leading the team and ensuring solution uptime, result quality, and managing the planning and development of new features. Part of this involved overseeing the deployment of an entirely new asset utilisation solution.
  - Client stakeholder engagement (technical and non-technical).

  The above was reported to the users via an in-house BI tool.

  <span class="tag">Spark</span>
  <span class="tag">SQL Server</span>
  <span class="tag">SQL</span>

- _Mining_. Simulation and optimisation of plant processes at a large gold mine, in order to increase gold output
  (particularly during periods of equipment downtime).

  My roles (software development and integration):

  - Development of a micro-service-based pipeline for running the optimiser and simulations, the fetching/transforming of source data, and the collection of results for reporting.
  - The integration of the simulator and optimiser into the pipeline. (The actual simulator and optimiser were handled by other members of my team.)
  - Assisted with the integration of a Power Apps + Power BI frontend.
  - Technical solution documentation.

  <span class="tag">RabbitMQ</span>
  <span class="tag">SQL</span>

- _Healthcare_. Development of an automated ML-based alert system for the early detection and prediction of outbreaks
  in hospitals (for a large healthcare provider). Given the specialised nature of infection control, good engagement
  with the client's domain experts (including soliciting feedback on results) was crucial.

  My roles (analytics engineering and data science):

  - Developing and maintaining the ETL pipeline.
  - Assistance with development (training, feature engineering, evaluation) of ML models.
  - The development of a Power BI dashboard for reporting on outbreaks.
  - Technical solution documentation.
  - SLA support.

- _Telecommunications_. Regular delivery of contract recommendations for upgrade and migration campaigns at a large
  telecommunications provider, together with reporting and post-campaign analysis. Strict adherence to numerous
  business and regulatory rules was crucial.

  My roles (SQL development and data analysis):

  - Development, maintenance, and operation of several recommender systems.
  - Design and implementation of a post-campaign analysis dashboard.
  - Running _ad hoc_ analyses upon request from client stakeholders.
