## Work experience

### Industry experience

**Oct 2023–** Technical Lead, Business Science Corporation

**Sep 2020–Oct 2023** Analytics Consultant, Business Science Corporation

Selected projects:

- _Logistics_ (_fuel, asset, and labour diagnostics_). Fuel consumption, asset utilisation, and labour utilisation
  diagnostics for a large logistics company. Starting as an intermediate analytics engtineer on the fuel consumption
  stream, I am now tech lead for the project.

  We've investigated:

  - Fuel: Identifying areas for improving fuel consumption.
  - Asset utilisation: Identifying locations where time is being wasted by trucks (say, when offloading), and hence can
    be improved.
  - Labour utilisation: Creating a holistic view of driver activity, especially with a view on overtime and compliance
    violations.

  The above is reported to the user via an in-house BI tool.

  <span class="tag">Qerent</span>

- _Fintech_ (_proof-of-concept trading platform_). The development of a (proof-of-concept) data-driven trading
  platform.

  As tech lead for the project, I was fully responsible for the technical implementation of the platform, and oversaw a
  data engineer who implemented a lakehouse architecture for our data requirements. The platform needed to support:

  - A framework for implementing trading strategies.
  - A simulation environment for backtesting strategies on historical data, and evaluating the results.
  - An optimiser for determining the best version(s) of particular strategies.

- _Mining_ (_plant simulation & optimisation_). Simulation and optimisation of plant processes at a large gold mine, in
  order to increase gold output (particularly during periods of equipment downtime).

  I led the development and integration of several micro-services that control the running of the optimiser and
  simulations, the fetching/transforming of source data, and the collection of results for reporting. (The actual
  simulations, optimiser, and reporting side was handled by other members of my team.) I also took responsibility for
  the solution design documentation.

**Oct 2018–Aug 2020** Analyst, Business Science Corporation

Selected projects:

- _Healthcare_ (_outbreak detection_). Development of an automated alert system for the early detection and prediction
  of outbreaks in hospitals (for a large healthcare provider). Given the specialised nature of infection control, good
  engagement with the client’s domain experts (including soliciting feedback on results) was crucial.

  My duties included developing the pipeline, and assisting with the development (training, testing, feature
  engineering, etc.) of machine-learning models for the outbreak detection. I also developed a Power BI dashboard for
  reporting on outbreaks, was responsible for the technical solution documentation, as well as SLA-type support.

- _Telecommunications_ (_contract recommender systems_). Regular delivery of contract recommendations for upgrade and
  migration campaigns at a large telecommunications provider, together with reporting and post-campaign analysis. Strict
  adherence to numerous business and regulatory rules was crucial.

  I was responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of several recommender systems, as well as the
  development of a post-campaign analysis dashboard. _Ad hoc_ analyses were also a common request from stakeholders.
