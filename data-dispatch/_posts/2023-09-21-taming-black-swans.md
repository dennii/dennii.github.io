Taming Black Swans: Long-tailed distributions in the natural and engineered world
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rE3DfeZ_jE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rE3DfeZ_jE).

A great talk by Allen Downey (of Probably Overthinking It) from this year's SciPy conference. Allen discusses the
dangers of modelling long-tailed distributions incorrectly (e.g., as lognormal), and shows several real-world examples
of such distributions. He also gives some techniques for modelling them better. I'm particularly happy I came across
this, as I've been working on some forecasting problems involving long-tailed distributions, and his talk gave me some
good ideasðŸ‘Œ.

If you've read The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, or are just generally interested in statistical modelling, then
you should find this talk of interest ðŸ¦¢ (sorry no blackÂ swanÂ emojisðŸ™ƒ).
