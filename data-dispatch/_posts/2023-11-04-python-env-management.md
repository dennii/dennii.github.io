Overview of Python env management and packaging tools: [https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/packaging_tools/](https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/packaging_tools/).

This is a fantastic overview of the various environment, package, publishing, building, and version management tools
for Python (such as pip, poetry, venv, etc., and a bunch I'd never heard of like hatch and flit).

A new tool—Rye (written in Rust)—caught my eye, as it supports Python version management, along with env, package, etc.
management. I've recently had to work with a few different versions of Python, and was doing it manually, so I've been
looking for a better solution.
