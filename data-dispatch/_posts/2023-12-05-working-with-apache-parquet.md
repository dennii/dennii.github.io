Working with Apache Parquet:
[https://blog.getdaft.io/p/working-with-the-apache-parquet-file](https://blog.getdaft.io/p/working-with-the-apache-parquet-file).

I've been doing some reading around open table formats, and came across this article (on the Daft blog) about Parquet
format and it's relation to Arrow.

It's a quick read, and gives a nice overview of Parquet, mentioning some specifics if you want to dig further. Most
surprising for me was learning that there are a number of new features in Parquet, but support for them is sadly
limited—so you end up having to restrict to older versions for compatibility purposes.
