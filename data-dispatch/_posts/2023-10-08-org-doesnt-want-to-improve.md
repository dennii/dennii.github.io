title: Your Org Probably Doesn't Want to Improve Things

I came across this article yesterday (it hit the front page of Hacker News):
[https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/).

It discusses dysfunction at companies, particularly large firms, and the wasteful, misdirected initiatives in
organisations (the primary example being orgs attempting to become data driven -- how I love that termðŸ¥²).

Being in consulting, I've worked with a number of large companies, and the article is spot-on in its description of
such orgs. Worryingly, I can start to see the same effects at my own firm, which raises the question of whether this is
simple a consequence of (profit-driven, business) orgs growing larger andÂ moreÂ complex.
