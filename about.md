Hi there! I'm Dennis Barrett, hailing from Johannesburg, South Africa.

During my initial university years, I immersed myself in mathematics, both pure and applied, as well as computer
science. This led on to a MSc[^1] and PhD[^2] in geometric control theory and nonholonomic Riemannian geometry,
respectively. I then spent a couple of years doing postdoctoral research in nonholonomic Riemannian geometry and the
geometry of homogeneous spaces.

After my postdoctoral studies, I transitioned into industry, working as a consultant---now Tech Lead---at
[Business Science Corporation](https://www.bscglobal.com). In this role, I've gained experience in, and an appreciation
for, data analysis/science/engineering, analytics engineering, and software development.

My interests are many and varied, spanning the gamut of mathematics, programming and computer science, and data. I hope
to share some of these interests on this blog and via my [Data Dispatch](/data-dispatch/) channels.
