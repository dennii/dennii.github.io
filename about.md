Hi there! I'm Dennis Barrett, hailing from Johannesburg, South Africa.

During my initial university years, I immersed myself in mathematics, both pure and applied, as well as computer
science. This led on to a MSc[^1] and PhD[^2] in geometric control theory and nonholonomic Riemannian geometry,
respectively. I then spent a couple of years doing postdoctoral research in nonholonomic Riemannian geometry and the
geometry of homogeneous spaces.

After my postdoctoral studies, I transitioned into industry, working as a consultant---eventually Tech Lead---at
[Business Science Corporation](https://www.bscglobal.com). In that role I gained experience in, and an appreciation
for, data analysis / science / engineering, analytics engineering, and software development. My current job involves
the development of a data-driven algorithmic trading platform. In this role, I have the opportunity to engage with all
my areas of interest: data engineering, data science, and software development.

I'm also available for consulting work, and I'm always happy to discuss ideas and projects. Feel free to reach out to
me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-di-barrett/) or [email](mailto:dbarrett6@gmail.com).

My interests are many and varied, spanning the gamut of mathematics, programming and computer science, and data. I hope
to share some of these interests on this website and via my [Data Dispatch](/data-dispatch/) channels.
